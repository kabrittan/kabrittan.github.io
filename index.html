			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<section id="main-bio">

			My name is Kyle Brittan and I am new to the web development field.  Although inexperienced, I have a passion for learning and teaching and the field of web development and software programming has always fascinated me.  As more and more technology becomes a greater part of our lives, it has become apparent that this field can lead to an almost unimaginable list of specialties in which a person with both logical and creative drives can express themselves.<p>I have approximately three years of undergraduate work that has been completed, primarily, at Glendale Community College and Arizona State University.  Although I had once pursued and undergraduate degree in Political Science with an intention of law school, I believe that I will go a different direction, academically.  Upon completion of this program with the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp, I will pursue a degree in Computer Science.<p>My employment history has been comprised primarily of supervision and management in transportation and logistics.  I have also had the opportunity to specialize in Quality Assurance and Safety.  This history has enabled me to acquire a variety of skill sets and experiences that will remain with me throughout my career as a professional web developer and software programmer.
